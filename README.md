## Description

This is an independant project for the coding school Epicodus. The intent is for the author to showcase their understanding of Ruby, routing, CRUD, and the framework Sinatra. This is displayed via a website that serves as a learning tool for children. The children should be allowed to compile a list of words they don't know (Create) which is shown on the display (Read). Upon clicking the word they can input what they think the definition is (Update), and delete either their working definition or the word itself (Delete). 

## Setup/Installation
_Note, this will require your local device to have Ruby installed_
* Clone this repository to your desktop
* Open the folder saved to your desktop with VSCode (or any other IDE capable of running Ruby scripts)
* Bundle the gems by typing 'gem bundle install'. This will also install Sinatra to the project
* Open a new terminal and from the root directory of the project type 'ruby app.rb'
* In the browser navigate to 'localhost:4567' 
* From there you may access the application and start adding, deleting, and editing words and their definitions.
